Bug Report: TypeMunger fails to apply inter-type declarations

Title: BcelTypeMunger throws IllegalStateException when applying ITD

Description:
When using inter-type declarations to add methods to target classes, 
the BcelTypeMunger fails with an IllegalStateException during weaving.
This seems to occur when the target class already has a method with similar signature.

Stack Trace:
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot apply ITD
    at org.aspectj.weaver.bcel.BcelTypeMunger.mungeNewMethod(BcelTypeMunger.java:456)
    at org.aspectj.weaver.bcel.BcelClassWeaver.weaveInterTypeDeclarations(BcelClassWeaver.java:789)
    at org.aspectj.weaver.bcel.BcelWeaver.weave(BcelWeaver.java:1234)
    at org.aspectj.weaver.bcel.LazyMethodGen.generate(LazyMethodGen.java:345)

Description Details:
The aspect defines an inter-type declaration to add a public method to a class.
However, if the class or any of its superclasses already has a similar method,
the munger cannot determine how to proceed and throws an exception.

Expected Behavior:
The munger should either:
- Detect the conflict and report a clear error message
- Skip the ITD if override is not intended

Actual Behavior:
IllegalStateException with unclear error message

Affected Components:
- BcelTypeMunger
- BcelClassWeaver
- LazyMethodGen
