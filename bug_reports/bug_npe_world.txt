Bug Report: NullPointerException in World.resolve()

Title: NullPointerException when resolving types during weaving

Description:
Getting a NullPointerException when the weaver tries to resolve a type during the weaving process. 
This happens specifically with generic types that have complex inheritance hierarchies.

Stack Trace:
java.lang.NullPointerException
    at org.aspectj.weaver.World.resolve(World.java:456)
    at org.aspectj.weaver.bcel.BcelWeaver.weave(BcelWeaver.java:890)
    at org.aspectj.weaver.bcel.BcelWorld.resolve(BcelWorld.java:234)
    at org.aspectj.weaver.TypeFactory.createParameterizedType(TypeFactory.java:67)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an aspect with pointcut targeting methods with generic return types
2. Configure the weaver to process classes with complex generics
3. Run the weaving process

Expected Behavior:
The weaver should successfully resolve the type and weave the aspect

Actual Behavior:
NullPointerException is thrown during type resolution in World class

Environment:
- AspectJ version: 1.9.7
- Java version: 11
- Occurs during both compile-time and load-time weaving
